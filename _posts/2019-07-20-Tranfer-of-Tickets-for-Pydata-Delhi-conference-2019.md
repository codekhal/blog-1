**Date**: 20 July 2019

Greetings from PyData Delhi!

If you are unable to be a part of the conference due to any unavoidable reason and 
wish to transfer your ticket to a friend or anyone else from the community, this information is for you.

> A --> Person with the ticket.

> B --> Person to whom A wants to transfer the ticket.

Send an email to [**pydatadelhi@gmail.com**](pydatadelhi@gmail.com) before **31st July 2019** with the subject **Ticket transfer**. Attach your original ticket and provide us the following information of the person to whom you are willing to transfer your ticket (B):

> - Name:
> - Email address:
> - First Name:
> - Last Name:
> - T-shirt size:
> - Mobile number:

On receiving the complete amount (Price of the ticket + taxes you paid us) from the person you are willing to transfer your ticket (B), **send us a screenshot of the same**. This can be easily executed using one of the multiple payment options available (BHIM/Paytm/Mobikwik etc ..)

On successful completion of the above steps, weâ€™ll transfer the ticket from our system and send both of you (A, B) a confirmation email.

If you are unable to find an interested person to transfer your ticket, then you can leverage the community group option on telegram as there you would find a lot of people keen on buying a ticket. Here is the link to join the **Pydata Telegram channel** : https://t.me/joinchat/B71pNUGrUQ7QHuyUJq-Ajg

See you there. 
Cheers !
