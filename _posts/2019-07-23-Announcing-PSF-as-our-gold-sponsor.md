Each year, PyData Delhi brings together an audience of more than 450 data science scientists, programmers, and professionals at a single platform: The PyData Delhi Conference. This flagship conference is proudly supported by a set of incredible sponsors who share equal credit in making this event a huge success.

The **Python Software Foundation** has the concurrent vision of creating an international community of Python programmers. They are constantly engaged in events such as conferences, sprints, meetups and user groups which aim at empowering the members of the global Python family.

In addition, the PSF underwrites and runs PyCon US, the primary Python community conference. Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community. Recently PSF became an open membership organization so that everyone who uses and supports Python can join and contribute to it.

> To know more about them, one can visit their website at  https://www.python.org/psf/membership.

We deeply value their contribution in helping us organise this conference and thank them for their support in sustaining the stature of this marque conference!
