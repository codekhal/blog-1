Each year, PyData Delhi brings together an audience of more than 450 data science scientists, programmers, and professionals at a single platform: The PyData Delhi Conference. This flagship conference is proudly supported by a set of incredible sponsors who share equal credit in making this event a huge success.

Our supporting sponsors include [**StickerMule**](https://www.stickermule.com/custom-stickers) which provide the fastest and easiest way platform to buy custom printed products. Within days, they can convert your designs and illustrations into custom stickers, magnets, buttons, labels and packaging.

Lastly, we also have onboard [**Coding Blocks**](https://codingblocks.com), who aim to create skilled software engineers for our country and the world. They aim to bridge the gap between the quality of skills demanded by industry and the quality of skills imparted by conventional institutes by providing a set of comprehensive tools and a well-trained faculty.
