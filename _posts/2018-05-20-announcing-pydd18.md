Ahoy everyone,

_Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning. Data Science. Deep Learning._

Now that we have your attention, we would like to tell you that these are not just buzz-words, but are among the technologies that developers and enthusiasts use, and come together to share and learn at PyData.

There are various talks and workshops delivered by top developers and researchers in data related fields, machine learning frameworks, recent advances in deep learning and many more using tools primarily in Python, but also including languages like R and Julia.

We aim to be an accessible and community-driven conference, with tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.

After the success of 1st edition of the conference with over 250 delegates from 28 cities and 5 countries, the 2nd edition of **PyData Delhi Conference** is now official and is scheduled for **August 11-12, 2018**.
