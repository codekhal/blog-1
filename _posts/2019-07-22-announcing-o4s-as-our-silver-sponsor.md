Each year, PyData Delhi brings together an audience of more than 450 data science scientists, programmers, and professionals at a single platform: The PyData Delhi Conference. This flagship conference is proudly supported by a set of incredible sponsors who share equal credit in making this event a huge success. 

O4S is also contributing to the conference, in the capacity of a silver sponsor. A SaaS-based technology startup, O4S enables companies to have a 360Â° control over their downstream supply chain via a suite of easily scalable desktop software and mobile apps. O4S is currently working with over 25 prominent brands including ITC Limited, PepsiCo Inc. etc.

We deeply value their contribution in helping us organise this conference and thank them for their support in sustaining the stature of this marque conference!
