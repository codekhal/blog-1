Hola! <br>
Greetings from PyData Delhi!

Are you uncertain about attending this year's conference due to the some bounding pressure of your boss, here we present you a simple yet powerful template for an application letter which will indeed help you to convince him.

> If you wish to build and grow your professional career and networking skills, you've got to get out there and meet people.      

So, let's get started:

Dear ______,

I am writing to request approval to attend the third edition of PyData Delhi Conference, an education programme of NumFOCUS, to be held on 3-4 August 2019 at IIIT Delhi. PyData brings together developers, programmers, scientists, researchers and others from the Python community to come together to share and learn about advancements in the language, application techniques and further Open Source developments.

If I get an opportunity to attend this conference, I think it will be very beneficial for me as an individual and in turn will help me contribute in a better way at the organisation level as well. The benefits it offers are innumerable. To list a few: 

1. I am particularly keen on attending the keynote presented by **Dr. Viral Shah** who is the Co-Founder and CEO at Julia Computing. He will be talking about Differentiable programming which I think will be beneficial for me as it _(something about it being unexplored yet powerful)___.
I am also willing to attend the keynote presented by **Prukalpa Sankar** on The Power of data science to measure unmeasured parameters in Emerging Markets.

2. The conference features keynotes, workshops and talks that will significantly benefit my work such as (Mention 2-3 relevant ones)

3. This should provide me with loads of opportunities to network, share ideas and hopefully build partnerships with people who could prove to be important to our business growth.

4. The conference appears to have been designed to optimise attendees learning so that they come away with actionable insights. 

The regular ticket costs only Rs. _______. The tickets include access to all PyData Delhi keynotes, talks, workshops, an official PyData Delhi T-shirt, goodies along with lunch and snacks in the evening for both days. 
I strongly believe, my attendance at this conference is a wise investment and will pay off for years to come.

Iâ€™ll be sure to submit a post-conference report or write a blog post that will include an executive summary, major takeaways, tips and pictures from the conference.

Please check out the conference website at https://pydata.org/delhi2019 . I have been following the conference twitter stream @PyDataDelhi, and there is a lot of buzz about this event!    

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to your reply.
Regards.

We really hope your boss will pay heed to your words, and we shall see you at the Conference.

Cheers!
