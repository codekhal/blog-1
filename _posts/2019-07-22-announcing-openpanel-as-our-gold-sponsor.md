Each year, PyData Delhi brings together an audience of more than 450 data science scientists, programmers, and professionals at a single platform: The PyData Delhi Conference. This flagship conference is proudly supported by a set of incredible sponsors who share equal credit in making this event a huge success.

OnePanel is an open and extensible platform for building, training and deploying reproducible deep learning applications at scale.
A Kubernetes based platform, OnePanelâ€™s pre-built environments are loaded with familiar open-source tools and can scale to many instances for training complex models.

We deeply value their contribution in helping us organise this conference and thank them for their support in sustaining the stature of this marque conference!
