Each year, PyData Delhi brings together an audience of more than 450 data science scientists, programmers, and professionals at a single platform: The PyData Delhi Conference. This flagship conference is proudly supported by a set of incredible sponsors who share equal credit in making this event a huge success.

[**GOJEK**](https://www.gojek.io/), one of our platinum sponsors, is widely known as a Super App. GOJEK’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery and two dozen services operates in 204 cities and regencies in five Southeast Asian countries.

GOJEK’s India team is a 12-person engineering team that works tirelessly to handle 1,000,000+ drivers and an average of 35 orders every second.

Its global counterpart, GOJEK, is Indonesia’s first and fastest-growing on-demand empire. In 2018, GOJEK processed more than US$9 billion annualized gross transaction value (GTV) across all markets where it operates, making it the largest consumer transactional technology group on a GTV-basis across South East Asia.

The GOJEK app was first launched in January 2015 for consumers in Indonesia and has since evolved into the largest on-demand multi-service platform in Southeast Asia, providing access to a wide range of services from transportation and payments to food delivery, logistics and many other on-demand services.

We deeply value their contribution in helping us organise this conference and thank them for their support in sustaining the stature of this marque conference!
