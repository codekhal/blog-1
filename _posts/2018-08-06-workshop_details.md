You can find the details and prerequisite for each workshop below:

## 1. Network Science, Game of Thrones and US Airports
#### *Mridul Seth*

**Workshop abstract:**  
Network Science deals with modeling and analyzing networks. Politics, mathematics, law, finance, pretty much any data can be modelled as a network and in this tutorial we introduce the basic of network theory using the pydata ecosystem(NetworkX, Pandas, matplotlib) and we will use a Game of Thrones character network and the US Airport dataset to look at some real world network data.

**About the speaker:**  
Mridul is trying to understand the world around us using data and tools from network science, currently at UCLouvain. He is an open source enthusiast and has been selected for Google Summer of Code, and is involved with NumFOCUS. He has given multiple tutorials at PyCon, PyData, and EuroScipy to share his love of Python and network science.

**Audience Level:**  
Intermediate

**Requirements:**  
Python 3 and Anaconda installed  
Libraries used: networkx, pandas, matplotlib, numpy and jupyter
